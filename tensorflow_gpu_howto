First- check whether your gpu is cuda compatible:
1. type    control /name Microsoft.DeviceManager    in command prompt (cmd)
2. Your gpu(s) is/are listed under Display Adapters, you can check if this is cuda compatible on the nvidia website
3. if there is a triangle with an exclamation point next to your gpu, your driver update might have messed things up. 
   Right click on the gpu and select properties. Select roll back driver update. This should fix the problem and the
   comment in the properties should say device working properly.
   
Second - install anaconda if you don't have it already

Third - open anaconda prompt and type : conda create --name tf_gpu tensorflow-gpu
    This creates a new environment and installs everything necessary for tensorflow-gpu, including the right cuda and cudnn version
    
Last - check your installation by typing:
1. conda activate tf_gpu
2. python
3. sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))
The log_device_placement argument prints the gpu detected. Make sure the name of your gpu is printed in the console.

Happy Deep Learning!
